				Miplatform uses a data type that is MiPlatform-specific to transfer data. 
				The commonly used type is Dataset object. 
				Dataset is only for MiPlatform, so for simple CRUD functions, 
				server logic such as Java Generics can be used through common handling. 
				Therefore, when application is developed based on MiPlatform, 
				developer will be provided with a common server module so that Service or DAO does not have to be developed 
				for implementing CRUD function that has no complex or special work logic.
